# SOLID Principles in Practice

## Description

This repository provides practical examples of the SOLID principles in object-oriented design, using C#. The SOLID principles are a set of design guidelines that help developers create more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software systems. Each principle is demonstrated through well-structured code examples, showcasing common violations and their respective refactorings.

## SOLID Principles Covered

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
   - Ensures that a class has only one reason to change, promoting high cohesion and low coupling.
   - Example: A class that initially handles multiple responsibilities is refactored into multiple classes, each with a single responsibility.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**
   - States that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - Example: Demonstrating how to extend the functionality of a payment processing system without modifying its existing codebase.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**
   - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
   - Example: Refactoring a hierarchy of classes to ensure that subclasses can be used interchangeably with their base class.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**
   - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
   - Example: Breaking down large, monolithic interfaces into smaller, more specific ones that are tailored to the needs of individual clients.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
   - Example: Implementing dependency injection to decouple high-level business logic from low-level data access code.

## Structure

- Each principle is presented in its own directory.
- Each directory contains:
  - **Violation:** A code example that violates the principle.
  - **Refactoring:** A refactored version of the code that adheres to the principle.
  - **README.md:** A detailed explanation of the principle, including why the original code violates it and how the refactoring solves the problem.

## Usage

Clone the repository and explore each principle to understand how to apply SOLID design principles in your projects. The examples are designed to be simple and easy to understand, making them ideal for both beginners and experienced developers looking to reinforce their understanding of SOLID.
